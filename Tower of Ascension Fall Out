Hello,
A while back when I was playing the Tower of Ascension quest I was progressing through the first floor when a strange thing happened.
When I went through the teleporter to the next floor, I glitched and fell through the map into the void, and since I couldn't die, I did /kill and whenever I try to redo the floor and turn in the mob items, nothing happens.
I believe that my progress is still saved on that level, and it's just I can't get back up there.
